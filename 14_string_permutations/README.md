#STRING PERMUTATIONS

##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

Write a program to print out all the permutations of a string in alphabetical order. We consider that digits < upper case letters < lower case letters. The sorting should be performed in ascending order.

##INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a file containing an input string, one per line. E.g.

hat
abc
Zu6

##OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print to stdout, permutations of the string, comma separated, in alphabetical order. E.g.

aht,ath,hat,hta,tah,tha
abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba
6Zu,6uZ,Z6u,Zu6,u6Z,uZ6
